# Contributions
I'm open to contributions to the mod, to get started follow the below instructions.

## Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/iamrobotboy/mod-wayward-weightless.git
cd mod-wayward-weightless
npm i install @wayward/types@2.10.7-beta
```

## Building
The mod is built using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which means you'll need to run a TypeScript build task to transpile it down to a JavaScript file.

Typically you'd have to set up the building configuration manually but I've already done this configuration for Visual Studio Code. So open the cloned repository with Visual Studio Code and build with `Ctrl+Shift+B`
